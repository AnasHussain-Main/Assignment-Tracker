 <!-- This collection file uses EJS templating, specifically the assignments.forEach(assignment => { %> script, 
  to iterate over the list of assignments retrieved from the database. For each assignment, it dynamically generates an HTML structure displaying the
   assignment's title, description, due date, and action buttons for editing and deleting.  -->
